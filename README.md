This was an interesting project because over the summer I took a course on SQL and PYTHON and how to combine both but that was on my old laptop and I had my right versions installed so I never ran into trouble with connecting the databases with Pycharm ide but this time it was different. The 8.1 version and Up from MySQL had a different syntax and I was not aware of it my execute commands would just not work so I did some research and learned about sqlite3 with was a built in SQL database soft ware for small projects like this. And most of the execute commands were very similar to what i had been taught over the summer. I also was familiar with Tkinter due to my previous project where A user inputs their real phone number and they get a update on covid cases. I made this project 2 years ago and it is still very dear to me because it was my first python project I ever did. With inspiration of that I knew i wanted to incorporate a GUI and i did and tkinter was the only way i knew how to in python atleast. I also want to link the color sheet I Used for my gui: https://www.plus2net.com/python/tkinter-colors.php and im going to link my youtube video too so you guys can futher understand what I was struggling with. I know my little database cant compete with anyones professional database but I hope I can develop this in the future more and keep on learning and adding to it.
