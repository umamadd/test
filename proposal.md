# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

EMPLOYEE DATABASE

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will use python and SQL to create a data base that lets you add and modify employees in a database

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?


Creating a simple employee management system involves designing a relational database, creating tables for employees, and implementing functionality to add and modify employee records. Here's an extended version of the system with more features, along with guidance on how to implement it using Python and SQL. Features are Employee ID (auto-incremented), First Name, Last Name,Date of Birth, Gender, Position,Department,Email,Phone,Number,Address, And it will be executed in python

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Maybe a statistics class, who require data from the database.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NONE

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I can add and modify and change successfully with the database

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If I could do it so I make a website and you can search for the employess name and their info comes up

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I wish to complete the coding and back end and do all the major fucntions properly

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will first, figure my plan with SQL and connecting the database to the ide, and go from there
